The main.c file has an abstact function called pixel_color that provides the intensitity
of the given color at the given pixel for the given frame.  Implement this function to
use this convenience function.

Output frame in main.c puts out lines representing each panel's RGB values.  The first
two characters are the address of the panel being addressed.  The next 64 characters
are the red values in hexadecimal; the next 64 are the green values in hexadecimal;
and the final 64 are the blue values in hexadecimal.  So there should be 194 characters
in total for each line.
